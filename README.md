# SguanFOC_Library
SguanFOC provides robust field-oriented control for sensored BLDC/PMSM motors. It supports multiple control modes using SVPWM, optimized math, and configurable PID. Features include encoder auto-alignment, Kalman filtering, and safety mechanisms for real-time embedded systems in robotics and CNC. Sensorless FOC is planned.
